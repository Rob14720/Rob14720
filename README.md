### Hi there 👋


Hey! Nice to meet you! My name is Robert Murphy and I'm a Graduate of the Bloomtech Institute of Technology for Full Stack Development! I'm currently looking for work so that I can get my foot in the door in the tech industry!
  I most recently learned Back-end testing and authorization with JSON web tokens :) I'm very interested in learning ANYTHING I can to give me an edge, or to further my education. ⚡⚡⚡
  I want to be able to be a reliable part of a team, small or large, that is involved in various media projects, no matter what they are. 👯👯 
  I think it is CRITICAL for every person's thoughts 💬 and ideas 🤔 to be presented, and with the guidance of our seniors, produce the work that has the highest standards possible!
  If there are any questions about my educational experience, repos I have worked on during that time, or any other question at all! Give me a call at 386-340-0214, or email me at Roberttsax18@gmail.com  

    Some fun facts about me:

   * I have a desire to be involved in the game industry in the future!
   * I have a black belt in traditional Okinawan Karate, and an Orange belt in Japanese Chikarakogeki Judo 🥋🥋!
   * I am a life-long yoga practitioner and meditator.
   * I play multiple instruments! Guitar 🎸, Saxophone 🎷, Bass 🎸, Drums 🥁, and sing a little too 🎤! :) 
   * I have multiple small hobbies, like writing for fun, I play Chess regularly, I draw in a graphic novel-style and actually won a few awards in High School, 
   including first place for best drawings out of nearly 400 other drawings! I teach traditional Yoga and meditation, and I have two adorable Husky mix doggos!🐕🐕
